# example module configuration file
# You can specify paths

# module-specific settings are only used when parsing this one file
module: []
# The following module-specific settings are implied based on the module's
# folder name/location. They can be overridden if you so desire.
#   * module.name = example_module
#   * module.path = [the directory this file is in]
#   * module.namespace = Digraph\Modules\${module.name}
#
# The following directories will be automatically used in a sane way, if they
# exist in module.path:
#  * templates: added as a template search path
#  * routes: added as a routing handler search path
#  * media: added as a media file search path

# any additional config is merged into the main CMS config. This means modules
# can alter absolutely any config option.
