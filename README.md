# Digraph
A CMS that treats content as a generalized directed graph (generalized to the point of even gracefully handling cyclical site maps). Nodes in the graph may have different types, different data structures, and may be connected to each other by any number of edges in any structure imagineable. This CMS is intended for extreme flexibility, and prioritizes flexibility above performance.

This repo contains the source code of the core of the CMS, as well as example code demonstrating how to use it. This is intended for more advanced development by users who are comfortable setting up their own entire system, and maintaining their own update schedule using Composer.

If you'd like to use a more beginner-friendly zip package to install Digraph, you're better off visiting the [digraph-dist repo](https://gitlab.com/byjoby/digraph-dist) to download a pre-packaged ZIP file containing a stable release of Digraph and its dependencies, which you can then unzip to your web server and have up and running with just some configuration file editing.

## Under active development
For the love of glob, don't use this thing in production yet.
There are no installation instructions or tools yet.
