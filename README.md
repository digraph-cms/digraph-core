# Digraph
A CMS that treats content as a (even potentially cyclical) directed graph.
Nodes in the graph may have different types, different data structures, and may be connected by different types of edges.
This CMS is intended for extreme flexibility, and prioritizes flexibility above performance.
That said, plans are in place to implement a smart output caching system that should make it workable for most reasonable loads.

## Under active development
For the love of glob, don't use this thing in production yet.
There are no installation instructions or tools yet.
